## I am an early-career microbiologist interested in studying host-microbe symbioses with a creative and interdisciplinary approach!

### Background
I grew up in the heart of Baltimore, MD, where my curiosity about the natural world began with stream walks in the woods surrounding my primary educational institution, The Park School of Baltimore. I later attended Smith College in Northampton, MA, where I received my Bachelor's Degree in Biology, with a minor in Studio Art. It was there that I first learned about the human microbiome and symbiogenesis, igniting a broader fascination with interdomain symbiotic relationships and their impact on evolutionary history. This led to my determination to pursue an academic career investigating host-microbe symbioses. 

I joined Dr. Nancy Moran's lab in 2020 as a graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin, where I have learned the value of investigating symbiosis at a molecular level. I am currently wrapping up my doctoral work investigating an enigmatic and little-studied family of insect specialist bacteria, the Orbaceae, in the _Drosophila melanogaster_ system.

I pride myself on my insatiable curiosity, creative mindset, and varied skillset. Though the majority of my experience is in wet lab techniques, I have enjoyed using bioinformatic approaches extensively since starting my PhD. One of my favorite aspects of science is the amount of creativity, problem-solving, and attention to detail it requires. I can't believe how lucky I am to spend each day learning more about the natural world--and have fun while doing so!

Outside of the lab, I enjoy swimming, paddleboarding, nature walks, and making art!
