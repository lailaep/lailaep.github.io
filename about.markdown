# Hey there! I'm Laila.
I am an early-career researcher interested in studying host-microbe symbioses with a creative and interdisciplinary approach!

## Background
I grew up in the heary of Baltimore, MD, where my curiosity about the natural world began with stream walks in the woods surrounding The Park School of Baltimore. I attended Smith College in Northampton, MA, where I received my Bachelor's Degree in Biology, with a minor in Studio Art. After completing an Honors Thesis investigating colicins in E. coli supervised by Dr. Robert Dorit, I fell in love with the flow and flexibility of wet lab work.
