## I am still discovering new things to be excited about every day, but here are some of my current research interests!
### Please welcome to the stage: _Orbaceae_!
In 2013, Waldan Kwong and Nancy Moran (described a novel family of Gammaproteobacteria: the _Orbaceae_)[https://doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.044875-0], the first member of which was (isolated in 2011 from boar dung)[https://doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.019026-0]. Recent developments in DNA sequencing technologies & resources have facilitated widespread surveys of animal microbiomes, revealing a frequent and exclusive association between _Orbaceae_ and insects, particularly among the Holometabola. This fidelity between a major group of bacteria and insects is striking, and offers an avenue for investigating major gut microbiota of insects, and host specificity in animal-microbe symbioses. Yet, few culture-based studies have investigated the _Orbaceae_. They are practically begging to be investigated!

### What determines host-microbe specificity?
I am very curious about how specific associations between hosts and microbes evolve. Even a few genomic changes have a drastic effect on bacterial ecology. For example, in bee gut microbiomes, different strains of the same species of bacteria (_Snodgrassella alvi_) specifically associate with honeybees or bumblebees.
