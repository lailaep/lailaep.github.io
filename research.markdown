## I am still discovering new things to be excited about every day, but here are some of my current research interests!
### How do host-associated microbes colonize?

  <p>
    Microbes are everywhere, but how do some manage to persist inside a host?
    I am interested in the strategies microbes use to do this—such as adhesion
    to host mucosal surfaces, evasion of host immune responses, and resistance
    to host antimicrobial effectors.

### What determines host-microbe specificity?

  <p>
    I am very curious about how specific associations between hosts and microbes evolve, particularly at a molecular level.
    Even a few genomic changes have a drastic effect on bacterial ecology. For example, in bee gut microbiomes, different
    strains of the same species of bacteria (<em>Snodgrassella alvi</em>) specifically associate with honeybees or bumblebees, and we have recently observed major differences in the ability of closely-related bacteria (family: <em>Orbaceae</em>) to colonize a specific genetic background of <em>Drosophila melanogaster. </em>

### Please welcome to the stage: <em>Orbaceae</em>!

    In 2013, Waldan Kwong and Nancy Moran
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.044875-0">
      described a novel family of Gammaproteobacteria: <em>Orbaceae</em>
    </a>,
    the first member of which was
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.019026-0">
      isolated in 2011 from boar dung
    </a>.
    Recent developments in DNA sequencing technologies and resources have
    facilitated widespread surveys of animal microbiomes, revealing a frequent
    and exclusive association between <em>Orbaceae</em> and insects, particularly
    among the Holometabola (insects that undergo complete metamorphosis).
    This fidelity between a major group of bacteria and insects is striking and
    offers an avenue for investigating major gut microbiota of insects and host
    specificity in animal-microbe symbioses. Another great thing about the
    <em>Orbaceae</em>: they are culturable and genetically tractable, enabling
    mechanistic-level discoveries. Further, they are naturally associated with the fruit fly <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, which is a powerful genetic model organism. The availability of genetic tools for both sides of a host-microbe association is unusual, and a major strength of this model system! </p>
