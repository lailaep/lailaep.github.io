## I am still discovering new things to be excited about every day, but here are some of my current research interests!

### What determines host-microbe specificity?
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/specificity_icon_lg.gif' | relative_url }}"
       alt="specificity" width="100" height="100"
       style="flex-shrink: 0;" />
  <p>
    I am very curious about how specific associations between hosts and microbes evolve, particularly at a molecular level.
    Even a few genomic changes have a drastic effect on bacterial ecology. For example, in bee gut microbiomes, different
    strains of the same species of bacteria (<em>Snodgrassella alvi</em>) specifically associate with honeybees or bumblebees.

### How do host-associated microbes colonize?
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/adhesion_icon_lg.gif' | relative_url }}"
       alt="adhesion" width="100" height="100"
       style="flex-shrink: 0;" />
  <p>
    Microbes are everywhere, but how do some manage to persist inside a host?
    I am interested in the strategies microbes use to do this—such as adhesion
    to host mucosal surfaces, evasion of host immune responses, and resistance
    to host antimicrobial effectors.

### Please welcome to the stage: <em>Orbaceae</em>!
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <img src="{{ 'assets/orbus_icon_lg.gif' | relative_url }}"
       alt="Orbus" width="100" height="100"
       style="flex-shrink: 0;" />

    In 2013, Waldan Kwong and Nancy Moran
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.044875-0">
      described a novel family of Gammaproteobacteria: <em>Orbaceae</em>
    </a>,
    the first member of which was
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.019026-0">
      isolated in 2011 from boar dung
    </a>.
    Recent developments in DNA sequencing technologies and resources have
    facilitated widespread surveys of animal microbiomes, revealing a frequent
    and exclusive association between <em>Orbaceae</em> and insects, particularly
    among the Holometabola (insects that undergo complete metamorphosis).
    This fidelity between a major group of bacteria and insects is striking and
    offers an avenue for investigating major gut microbiota of insects and host
    specificity in animal-microbe symbioses. Another great thing about the
    <em>Orbaceae</em>: they are culturable and genetically tractable, enabling
    mechanistic-level discoveries. They are practically begging to be investigated.
