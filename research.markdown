## I am still discovering new things to be excited about every day, but here are some of my current research interests!

### What determines host-microbe specificity?
I am very curious about how specific associations between hosts and microbes evolve, particularly at a molecular level. Even a few genomic changes have a drastic effect on bacterial ecology. For example, in bee gut microbiomes, different strains of the same species of bacteria (_Snodgrassella alvi_) specifically associate with honeybees or bumblebees.

### How do host-associated microbes colonize?
Microbes are everywhere, but how do some manage to persist inside a host? I am interested in the strategies microbes use to do this--such as adhesion to host mucosal surfaces, evasion of host immune responses, and resistance to host antimicrobial effectors.

### Please welcome to the stage: _Orbaceae_!
In 2013, Waldan Kwong and Nancy Moran [described a novel family of Gammaproteobacteria: the _Orbaceae_](https://doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.044875-0), the first member of which was [isolated in 2011 from boar dung](https://doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.019026-0). Recent developments in DNA sequencing technologies & resources have facilitated widespread surveys of animal microbiomes, revealing a frequent and exclusive association between _Orbaceae_ and insects, particularly among the Holometabola (insects that undergo complete metamorphosis). This fidelity between a major group of bacteria and insects is striking, and offers an avenue for investigating major gut microbiota of insects, and host specificity in animal-microbe symbioses. Another great thing about the _Orbaceae_--they are culturable and genetically tractable, enabling mechanistic-level discoveries. They are practically begging to be investigated!
