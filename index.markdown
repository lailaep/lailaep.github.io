# Hi, I'm Laila [E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsl3IBAsEH4){:target="_blank"}. Phillips!

I am a PhD student in Dr. Nancy Moran's lab at The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.
I am broadly interested in host-microbe symbioses, with a current focus on interactions between _Drosophila melanogaster_ and host-restricted bacterial symbionts (family: _Orbaceae_) we recently isolated from wild-caught flies! You can read our most recent paper on this topic [here!](https://doi.org/10.1099/ijsem.0.006516)

I am expecting to graduate in Summer 2026 and I am seeking a postdoctoral position in symbiosis research.
