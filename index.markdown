# Hi, I'm Laila E. Phillips

I am a PhD student in Dr. Nancy Moran's lab at The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.
I am broadly interested in host-microbe symbioses, with a current focus on interactions between _Drosophila melanogaster_ and host-restricted symbionts (family: _Orbaceae_) we recently isolated from wild-caught flies!
