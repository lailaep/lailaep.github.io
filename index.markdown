# Hi, I'm Laila [E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsl3IBAsEH4){:target="_blank"}. Phillips!


I am a PhD student in Dr. Nancy Moran's lab at The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.
I am broadly interested in host-microbe symbioses, with a current focus on interactions between _Drosophila melanogaster_ and host-restricted symbionts (family: _Orbaceae_) we recently isolated from wild-caught flies!
